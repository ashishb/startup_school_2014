Founder, IndieGogo

Getting access to capital is difficult to do business you want to do.
I started journey from Wall St. its a great training ground.
Met Hollywood industry, found struggling artists and I was representing a bank, they were looking for money.
I got letter from an old person, begging me for money.
It was a pivotal moment, I called my mom (what any young girl does) and cribbed about it.
The mom was busy with business, she said if you are that pissed off, do something about it and hung up.

Did a play, investors invited, they showed up thanked and left without giving money for full production of the play. Lost job when company came to know about it.
Actors and audience who really wanted a play to be productionized are controlled by gatekeepers called investors.

That's why started Indiegogo before crowd funding word was popular.

Lessons

#1 Why

 to democratize access to capital, it gets your **ego out of the way**, it gets you through your **dark period** (2008 came in, did not take salary for ~3 years), if the why is not good enough, you won't stick out through dark periods, since entrepreneurship is pretty hard. It made our strategy global, it decides optionalities in the strategy. Best **talent** is not looking for job, they will be attracted only because of a good "why". It attracts **customers**. 
The "5 why" B-school exercise is useful.

#2 Be intentional about the culture

There is **always a culture** whether you admit it or not, key is to make it a priority.

Diversity drives innovation - 45% overall female.

Values and behaviors.
 Values - fearlessness(disrupting capital access industry), authenticity, collaboration and empowerment (really wanted to help people)
Define and revisit behavior from time to time.
2010 - "aggressively goes after opportunities"
2014 - "ruthlessly prioritizing"

Operationalize - ??

Measure how well its coming along 

#3 Technology is just a means not an end.

Before KPCB invested, they emphasized that irrespective of investment, that you have built a really important company.
Focus on building something meaningful which world needs and not how to grow fast (that will happen as a consequence)
