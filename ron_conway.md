An entrepreneur is entrepreneur for life. 

Q: Which traits are to be born with?
A: Ambitious, aggressive, tough since its pretty hard to start a company.

You cannot learn to be ambitious and be driven, its something one has to be born with.
You have to learn how to manage, how to hire a team, these are to be acquired over time.

Q: How can you tell if someone is an entrepreneur or not?
A: Only if they are ready to work 24-7, company is first priority (above S.O.), its a vocation. If you have that commitment than your passion is infectious.

PG: For management, lead by example.
RC: They are lot of blogs on skills to be acquired. Once, you have figured out skills which are to be 

Your idea has to be infectious enough to find a co-founder.
RC: 20th year of angel investing, > 750 companies invested in. conversations with 30 companies for investing in one.
As of now, I don't do diligence, SC Angel team does that, I help portfolio companies with hard problems.

PG: How does SV Angel works?
RC: wise old man perform the pattern recognition, generation planning is important, some people in 30s and some in 20s (one in 30s do advice, one in 20s do company picking). Smart 20 year olds are important.

PG: How important is college?
RC: Whenever you get an aha moment about an idea, its a personal experience and you are so motivated to work on it where ever you are, that's the moment.
Chad found no easy to share party video with friends.

PG: How much you care about the story?
RC: The more personal and stronger the story is, the more I am inspired by it. I ask why they are motivated to start the company.

RC: Its very important to see how founders interact, how they met and how they get along. If one founder interrupts other, that's a red herring.

PG: How to find potential co-founder?
RC: Most co-founders collaborate and come up with the idea together, there are two founders for most successful company. A co-founder is usually a colleague, friend. Co-founders share 99% of excitement about the idea.

PG: Half the YC applicants are single co-founders.
RC: Ben Silverman - people should use internet to discover things. He evangelized people slowly, till he found a co-founder who is excited enough to work on it as co-founder.

PG: How to know a lame idea is actually lame?
RC: Persistence and conviction about the idea. As an investor, we cannot tell that, we invest in people. Rifle focused on the product - applies to every successful co-founder (to the extent of being rude and arrogant). That focus is contagious enough to make people join you. Airbnb is counterintuitive, 2008 crisis helped Airbnb.

PG: What did you like about Drew Huston?
RC: We did not invest early on, since we did over analysis of idea and did not like it. We should have invested just in people.

PG: Why are you making this mistake even after 20 years?
RC: I decide a marketplace to invest in and then invest in top 20 companies. In 1994, we decided to invest not in hardware or packaged software (since I already did that), I decided to invest in Internet companies.

RC: I like meeting co-founder BF (before famous), there is nothing more exciting about being part of the rocket ship which took of, money/fame etc. is all by-product.
I don't see them much AF but we are kindred spirit.

RC: will this person work 24-7, is he a good communicator, will he follow through?

PG: Who can fool other investors and not you?
RC: If they don't care about product then that's a warning sign, they should be excited about it. Larry, Jack Dorsey, Ben all cared about the product and nothing else.

PG: What do young founders do wrong?
RC: Focus on traction, if product does not have traction, better do something about it, don't live in denial. Team will recognize before you but will till you admit it. Its the job founder to initiate the conversation about it.
Firing and lay offs are good when being low on money, morale improves afterwards, since dead woods are made to go first.
