#Hosain Rehman (CEO, Jawbone)

Started working on Siri like voice interaction layer on phones in 97-98.
It was hard to raise half a million dollars since people were not in for mobile.
Invented noise-cancellation tech, reached out to Nokia, Samsung etc. but they liked but no one wanted to buy it since it was too expensive. (iPhone now has 6 microphones for noise cancellation)

DARPA came in and funded for noise cancellation in battle fields.
8 engineers, one of the first companies to move to SF (after Adobe and Macromedia).
In 2002, thought head sets could be good target use case.
Till that point, Apple and Palm are the only VC funded successful hardware companies.
Raised funding, failed to sell the product, money ran out, investors took control over the company, doors locked.

We started from blank slate, no salary for 2 years.
Launched on Dec 21, partnership with AT&T, customs issue at JFK, made $70M in first year.
2008 crash led to cancellation of lot of orders.
2011, UP was launched, it was good but customers were having issues.

With hardware, you have to make stuff for which people will pay you more for what it takes to make it.
