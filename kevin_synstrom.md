Kevin Synstrom (founder, Instagram) with Garry Tan

GT: Someone in audience can end up being really big
KS: That's just the birthday paradox (its bound to happen).

I had pirate radio station outside my house in high school.
Ended up at Stanford, since it was better than suburb of Boston for both good life + do things.

Worked at TreeList, studied at Florence for 3 months, it was too cold but I was still working/promoting (in Stanford) on it under poor network availability. The fact I did not know ground reality encouraged me to work on it (since I did not know how bad idea it was)
What people say and do is different.

GT: What should be the first move of fresh grads?
KS: There is no perfect move (get rid of that idea), everyone is different. Marines say you can spend all the time thinking but by the time, you decide to make a move, you will be dead. Its move which takes you to next step. Its the summation of your moves and experiences which shapes you. Every little experience you have adds up.

GT: Experience at Google?
KS: I took Marketing position at Google instead of all other options which has least salary (but best people). Worked in corp dev, in 2008, boss told no more deals, just go golfing, left the job and joined NextStop which was really good experience.
Combinatorial entrepreneurship - take a bunch of hot terms and combine them to generate an idea.
Used HTML5 since did not know native iOS app building.
His girlfriend - I do not like posting photos since they are as good as another friend's.
KS - Because he uses filters and some other advanced photo techniques.
His girlfriend - then you should add that.
KS - we added them and that became Instagram.

KS - Hiring starts before the company, since it starts with relationship building. I worked at Odeo and Jack Doresy joined one day. Valley is smaller than number of people in this room.

KS - Launched app in midnight and people started installing it - first set of users were from Asia and Germany (since it was day there). We were on single server (did not hear about AWS till then). We asked for another server and co-lo was too slow to provide it, at 9 AM when people tweeted about it, it was down.

KS - building photo apps is easy, building a community around it is difficult, your users are your greatest assets. Building community from scratch is difficult. First hire was a community manager (not engineer).
