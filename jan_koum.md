Jan Koum (cofounder, WhatsApp) and Jim Goetz with Sam Altman

SA: First time, founder and board member together on stage.

SA: What's JK's background in Ukraine.
JK: No internet back then in 90's, focus on learning, picked Computer Science.

SA: you spent 9 years at Yahoo! after drop out.
JK: Brian and I met in 1988 before I joined Yahoo when I was doing computer security audits. David Filo was role model then. Company grew from 500 to thousands of servers over years. Tapped network of senior engineers from Yahoo for WhatsApp.

JG: Joining Yahoo in its growth period was pretty useful and JK learned a lot because of that. His approach to focus came from Yahoo. David called him to leave school fully (he did school and Yahoo for !2 weeks together).

JK: I never thought I would start a company, I always wanted to make a good product (which is more exciting). Brought iPhone in Jan 2009, few months after SDK came out, started playing around and built an app, original idea was about status not messages.

SA: How did you two meet?
JG: JK does not like talking to anyone in investment community, initial mails were rebuffed. First time, met in Red Rock and JK was bit skeptical then.
At that time, iPhone app revenues were sufficient to keep the company alive.
Gamble to build Nokia and BB app worked at that time.
There was no urgency to raise money, aim for build good product.

SA: why Sequoia then?
JK: Sequoia supported Google/Apple/Cisco, they have pedigree which other VCs don't have.

SA: Why WhatsApp?

JG: WhatsApp became dominant globally in App Store, we were looking at messaging space, the next 
few months, there was no way to figure them out, no public address, no one knows where these people are. They ignored PR inbound as well.

JK: We had no time, we were focused on answer customer queries. We hired dedicated support around 150M users.


SA: You are pretty anti-silicon valley (ignored PR, ignored Sequoia, charged 0.99$ per year).

JK: We are engineers, we hate meetings. We added charging to slow growth to better support current customers (and have good service for them).We decided to stay under the radar, so that, we are not distracted from building great product.

SA: What's the best product decisions you made?
JK: No user names but phone numbers. Why introduce an extra layer of handshake, when you already have the number in the address book?
Ability to tap into address book and use that as a graph.

SA: What's the worst product decision?
JK: Its difficult to remove stuff, status is a legacy functionality, we want to remove it but a few million people are using it.

SA: Why Erlang?
JK: I did not know it but I was looking for open source XMPP server, found first one in Erlang and its one of the best product decisions, we ever made.

SA: How conversation started with Zuck?
JK: FB has gone through same things, we will go through, they have a lot of good teams like Finance, biz dev etc. We shared common vision, a lot of companies focused on silicon valley, MZ had vision of connecting everyone in the world and we always grew internationally. That's why we decide to do things together. Being in separate office, allows us to focus better on the product.

JG: JK lost his mom and sister while being at Yahoo. He always wanted to work on product which cross international boundaries.

JK: Our job is not sexy, we focus on small things like how to make app faster, how to take care of changing SIM cards and similar edge cases to build a good product.
