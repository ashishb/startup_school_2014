Reid Hoffman (co-founder, LinkedIn) with Sam Altman

SA: How was LinkedIn started?
RH: Paypal was losing money heavily (millions of dollars a month). LinkedIn was one of the idea I suggested for that. Then Paypal was sold to Ebay, afterwards I took 3 weeks off and then worked on this idea.

SA: why would it work (in 2002 when people had given up on consumer internet)?
RH: I strongly believed, everyone should have a public professional identity.

Getting first 1000 users was easy, first 13 people at the company sent out the mails.
Added address book uploading facility which was pretty useful.

People believe - an open capital market is good thing for entrepreneurs, its not.
Since at that time, not just money, but competition for talent and market is pretty high.
More successful companies were started during downturns.
Every year 0-5 companies really matter.

Advice

1. Do something very contrarian (not "airbnb for dogs")
2. Focus on potentially big markets (like bitcoins today)
3. Every good startup has weeks or months of periods where confidence goes down, the goal at that time is to figure out what's has to be done to get back onto right track.

Advice

Don't try to raise as much money as possible.
Raise may be slightly more than what you need otherwise, people will slack off.

RH: When raising money people thought we were friendster for business. We wanted to establish a separate category.

Advice

Only if adding nodes (people) can improve value of system in super linear fashion than its a network effect. Everything described as network does not have network effect. Marketplaces, social networks have that.

SA: what kind of companies you invest in?
RH: A company which adds a new value to ecosystem of humans, and then I focus on team.
If everyone says its a good idea (2/3rd said its a bad idea), then there is a bigger problem, you will face a huge competition then.

SA: How did you invest in FB?
RH: Heard of FB, felt Boston is a bad idea to invest in, Sean Parker called and said they have relocated to bay area, he invested after suggesting that Peter with lead the round.

Its important to have integrity as well as present integrity.
**Not only its important to have substance but to be able to present that as well**

RH: I see myself as someone adding value to human ecosystems. "the social network" which I tried in 1999 was a bad idea, it had a lot of mistakes, no real identity, no organic growth.

SA: Do you still believe that "real identity" is most important thing about FB?
RH: Yes, and that worked only since it was started in colleges.

SA: Investment in Zynga?
RH: FB launched app platform, photo sharing was a major use case but FB owned it, the other big category was games (since FB was not interested in doing games). 

SA: Why has FB a blind spot around games?
RH: Zuck is not a gamer.

SA: If you start a new company, what would it be on?
RH: People still underrate ubiquitous internet (everyone having smartphone), intelligence people do know that, so, you need to be focused, 2 years earlier, you could have done anything.

SA: Bitcoin?
RH: I think its a high beta outcome. There could be better ideas and more crypto currencies.

SA: What is one thing which you believe which people don't?
RH: Positively impacting the govt. (its water in aquarium and we are the fish), entrepreneurship can be learnt (high density networks help in that).
