# Emmet Shear (founder, justin.tv and twitch.io)

We were building calendar (similar to Google calendar before it came out) but 9 others companies had the same idea. That got sold on Ebay for quarter million dollars.
4 four founding team for the next product (live video broadcasting of once life).
Got huge media coverage.

**Don't give up**, focus on how to repurpose and make it work, opened platform to every one.
Learnt how to scale (had a lot of downtime).
At some point, company stopped growing, we could not answer that, since we did not know why we were growing in the first place.

Decided to have two goals - one targeting mobile (spun off social cam eventually), one targeting gaming. Now, this was year 5, I knew everything (engineering, product, hiring, scaling, monetization).
Bonus skill: How to talk to users. Six years of failing taught me enough to launch Twitch.tv in 2011.

Figure out important users (broadcasters).
Ask users (what they want). Avoid BD (till you a big company), its a gigantic distraction.
Generic advice does not work.
Its the skills gained in first 6 years, they were useful for finally making big in Twitch.tv.

Ensure **good mental and physical health** during the journey.
It takes ~8 years for outcome and it took us exactly 8 years.
