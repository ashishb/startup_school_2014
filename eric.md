Eric (founder, Pebble watch)

Built bike computer to be used while biking (standard in Polish culture).
Friend suggested it would be more useful as watch.

Started as inPulse (info pulse), won several pitch competitions and used them for funding the prototype.
Being in Waterloo in 2008, built first prototype which worked just with BB.
Worked with EE and CS guys for better products.
Built 3D printed prototype in 2009.

Sometimes, companies themselves leak the product to see what people think.
I emailed crackberry, engadget etc. sending them rendering and they called back and media showed as  "BB watch came out".

Reporter to BB CEO: what do you think of watch and he had no comments.
Called media a week later to clarify.
Got customer validation from BB users who showed interest (didn't ask for money).
**There is no wrong way to do press**.

We built first 500 watches by abusing university labs (despite being graduated).
Had broken devices during shipping.

Applied to YC.
Nice traction: 80% of users were using it every day.
Setup shop in MTV for building more watches.

In 2011, we launched SDK and we actually start showing time (it was not there in the first person).
Over 100 apps were launched in few months (there was ~500 devices in the field then).
At that time, it did not work with iPhone, we designed Pebble (after background application facility came out with iPhone 5 in mind 2011).

Talked to several VCs on sand hill, no interest.
PG suggested become a software company, he said no, Eric suggested kickstarter, PG learned and agreed for that.
Target: $100K.
Raised: $10M in 30 days.

Paul Buccheit: A startup product has to be able to do three things really well and be able to explain them to users as well.

1. Notification
2. Fitness apps
3. Customization (being able to download and install different watch faces)

5 people when launched on Kickstarter.
Flew to Asia (for manufacturing), next 6 months in Shenzhen.

In Dec 2012, assembly line started producing watches.

Back when it was started, Sony had a 400$ smart watch.
Now, Google is cramming smart phone in watch, Apple is building a shiny watch, we have a community which is interested in supporting the watch and building apps and customizations around it.
